## Development Installation

### Fedora 40

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo dnf install cargo rust make npm python3-beautifulsoup4 python3-flake8 ansible parallel uglify-js jemalloc
```

Build the project and run the server:

```bash
make
cargo run --release --bin server
```

### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal)

Follow the instructions for Fedora, but use this alternate command for installing dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cargo rust curl make npm python3-bs4 flake8 ansible parallel uglifyjs jemalloc
```

### Windows 10 (Native)

1. Download and install the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019).
    * When the installation menu appears, under the "Workloads" tab, select "C++ build tools" and press Install. A reboot will be required.

2. Install the [Rust language for Windows](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).

    * The default options are OK.

3. To clone this repository locally, [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). When given the option, select "Clone from URL" and enter `https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data.git` or the address to a personal fork.

4. In the Start Menu, open the Command Prompt.

    * Navigate to the repository directory. If you used GitHub Desktop, the command is `cd Documents\GitHub\opl-data`.
    * Run the checker: `cargo run --bin checker`.

### Docker

To run the server using Docker, simply build and run:

```bash
docker build -t opl .
docker run -p 8000:8000 opl
```

Access at <http://localhost:8000/> per usual.
