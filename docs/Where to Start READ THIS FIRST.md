# Where to Start READ THIS FIRST

A guide for new volunteers to the OpenPowerlifting project.

Thanks for getting involved!

There are many ways to contribute.  Most of them involve interacting with git in some way but a little knowledge goes a  long way and we have guides to help.

These guides are still in their infancy and, in some cases, are badly in need of an update.  Please do feel free to submit corrections or improvements to the guides as you work through them.  This will be incredibly valuable to those who come after you.

## Contribution Styles

Everyone contributes differently.  Some people never interact with the more technical elements of the project.  They might convert meet results to our format and email them in.  Or make simple changes as per the ["Simple changes easy method" guide](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/-/blob/main/docs/Simple-changes-easy-method.pdf).

If you are a bit more technically minded, you might want to try using a windows client to interact with git.  See guide ["Instructions for windows"](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/-/blob/main/docs/instructions-for-windows%20-%20needs%20updating.docx.pdf).  You will have to learn one or two git commands but nothing too challenging once you are set up and understand key concepts.  This will give you a good platform to add meets, disambiguate names and make other corrections.

There is a web IDE that some prefer and there are some instructional videos on this method in ["instructional videos"](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/-/blob/main/docs/instructional%20videos.md).

For those who already have a good grasp of git, you should get stuck right in with ["project-setup"](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/-/blob/main/docs/project-setup.md) and ["how to add a meet"](https://gitlab.com/openpowerlifting/opl-data/-/blob/main/docs/how-to-add-a-meet.md).

## A few notes

There is a steep learning curve here and getting your first merge request over the line is a real achievement.  Don't be discouraged if it takes a while to get the hang of it - a lot of us needed a lot of help to get started.  Ask for help if you are stuck.

Please post your questions in the relevant stream and topic in Zulip rather than sending DMs to individual members of the team.  Everyone volunteers as much or as little as they have capacity for  so this spreads the load a little bit and ensures that you aren’t accidentally bothering a team member while they are on holiday or under pressure at work.

Once you are up and running and ready to get started, it's up to you to pick something to work on - no one is going to allocate work to you.  Have a look at your own data, that of your friends, your federation.  Add instagrams, fix age problems and name mis-spellings.  Do a few easy fixes to get familiar with the project.  If you have capacity to help out with the issues queue, ask for access so that you can see the whole queue and then have a scroll through.  No one will ever be annoyed at you for doing some work.  Only steer clear of an issue if it is already allocated to someone as you don;t want to end up duplicating effort.
