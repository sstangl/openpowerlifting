# Brand Guidelines

This document describes general guidelines for how to communicate when representing the OpenPowerlifting project in a formal capacity. It is intended primarily for use by staff on social media when posting as the project.

These guidelines are not intended to be prescriptive. Rather, they are intended to showcase the "sprit" of the project.

## How OpenPowerlifting Sees Itself

### What the OpenPowerlifting Project Is

OpenPowerlifting is a project to archive powerlifting history and make that information useful as a service to the powerlifting community. The main output of the project is *the database itself*, not just the showcase website.

Basically: *we are the historians/record-keepers for all of powerlifting*.

"All of powerlifting" is taken very literally: *we remember lifters at every level of the sport, not just the elites*!

What sets the OpenPowerlifting project apart from other record-keepers is *the completeness of the data* and that *we do not attempt to control access to the data*.

In terms of completeness:

  1. All federations may have their data catalogued, regardless of size or fame.
  2. We do not alter the data from the federations in any way: we merely report their results. We do not pass judgment on federations' calls.
  3. All of our data is constantly run through an extensive error-checking test suite. We have *extremely high data quality*.
  4. We go out of our way to find old meet results that have been otherwise lost.

In terms of not controlling access to the data:

  1. Our database is made easily-downloadable in convenient formats, and people are actively encouraged to download it.
  2. All of our data is released into the public domain, so anyone can use it for any purpose.
  3. All of our code is released under Free Software licenses.
  4. No one is ever required to pay for access.
  5. The entire project is available on GitLab, and we actively solicit community contributions.

In addition, the project is *entirely funded by the powerlifting community*:

  1. The website has no ads.
  2. The project is 100% funded through voluntary contributions to our Patreon account.
  3. *We never mention that there is a Patreon account, and we absolutely never ask anyone to donate!*

### What OpenPowerlifting.org Is

[OpenPowerlifting.org](http://www.openpowerlifting.org) organizes and presents the database to lifters in a way that is useful and informative.

We don't impose viewpoints on users. Instead, they are given controls and encouraged to look at the data however they choose. For example, while PowerliftingWatch at one point made the controversial call to remove SPF lifters from their All-Time rankings, we would never do that. Instead, we might give lifters an option so that *they* can filter out a federation from the rankings. The choice is up to each lifter.

We don't try to keep users on the site as long as possible. Instead, we try to make it efficient for lifters to find the information they were looking for, or to just explore. We don't use attention-grabbing techniques, and we realize that it's perfectly normal for someone to not visit the website more than once a month. We're not going to become a social network.

Because we don't care about keeping users on the site as long as possible, we are free to link to other Web properties, such as Instagram, federations, and even competing sites. We collect all of the information from the powerlifting community and organize it to make it convenient.

Basically: we don't care how often people visit the website, but when someone wants to look up powerlifting information, we want them to think of OpenPowerlifting. We accomplish that through data quality and reputation over a long term.

The main page of the website is a ranking of all lifters by Wilks. This is intended to be motivating. The specific viewpoints that make it motivating are:

  1. Because of the tremendous number of lifters, a small personal improvement results in a very large jump in the all-time rankings.
  2. Because of the tremendous number of lifters, you can find someone at roughly your level with whom you can have motivating competition.


## How OpenPowerlifting Presents Itself

This section discusses communication styles when interacting with various groups.

As a brief summary:

  1. We will promote the various powerlifting federations, with respect, selflessly, without expecting any kickback or personal benefit.
  2. We will work with our competitors, with respect, selflessly, without expecting any kickback or personal benefit.
  3. We will promote the accomplishments of individual lifters, with respect, selflessly, without expecting any kickback or personal benefit.


### How OpenPowerlifting Presents Itself to Federations

OpenPowerlifting aggregates the results of the various powerlifting federations into one place, so lifters who competed in the IPF show up alongside lifters who competed in the USPA. Additionally, it becomes very obvious that many lifters compete in more than one federation.

This creates a challenging communications environment, because, for the most part, the various federations are in financial competition with each other and largely try to pretend that other federations do not exist or are somehow invalid.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that with the exception of only a few smaller federations, the vast majority of federations did not specifically request that their results be tracked, and do not help us track their results in any way.

In order to keep records accurately, we need cooperation from federations. Because we want to keep their results accurately, it is therefore critically important that we respect federations by following these guidelines:

  1. Actively promote federation-specific rankings. For example, we have the [USPA Lifter Rankings](http://www.openpowerlifting.org/?fed=USPA), the [RPS Lifter Rankings](http://www.openpowerlifting.org/?fed=RPS), and the [365Strong Lifter Rankings](http://www.openpowerlifting.org/?fed=365Strong). We have such rankings for every federation following the same URL pattern. Federations love these pages, because they exclude all competing federations from view. If someone sets a new federation-specific record, promote both the lifter and the federation!
  2. Never pit two federations against each other. For example, do not mention that someone in the USPA overtook someone in the SPF. Instead, focus on accomplishments of the individual lifters.
  3. Accede to federation demands. Because the records come from the federations themselves, if they request that something be changed, they remain the authority on whether the change is valid, and we should make that change.
  4. Use our voice to actively promote the various federations without any benefit to ourselves. We want to grow powerlifting, and that means growing the federations themselves.

Federations should be treated extremely well so that they want to support us. Our motives for gathering federation support are as follows:

  1. We want federations to accept the OpenPowerlifting federation-specific rankings as the official rankings for their federation. Doing this expands awareness of the project to their lifters -- and their lifters notice and report a lot of errors, which means that our data quality greatly improves.
  2. We want federations to stop using PDF for meet results and to switch to formats that don't lose formatting data, such as spreadsheets or HTML. In order to convince them to do this, they have to want to work with us, and we have to be pleasant to work with.


### How OpenPowerlifting Presents Itself to Competitors

This is mostly about PowerliftingWatch.

Our project is unfortunately overwhelming to the PowerliftingWatch maintainers, because they are not programmers, and we have extensive automation that allows us to both gather much more data and have much higher data quality. In addition, they have dedicated a lot of time and work into their site, and they attempt to recoup the cost of that labor by charging for their rankings, which we are unfortunately undermining by offering higher-quality rankings for free.

However, PowerliftingWatch does the following things that we do not:

  1. They post powerlifting news, including training footage.
  2. They maintain all-time rankings without maintaining proof (we require complete results from every meet, and some of the older meets with records have been completely lost).

Although PowerliftingWatch does not want to help us, we should want to help them, because lifters will still use their site for the above functions, and their maintenance of all-time rankings can help our accuracy. Therefore, we do not want to position ourselves as competitors.

The following guidelines are suggested for interacting with PowerliftingWatch:

  1. Do promote their record-keeping when doing so would be useful to lifters.
  2. Do not promote their paid rankings.
  3. *Do not even look at their paid rankings*, because their data is not made available for public use.
  4. Do not say that we are a "free alternative" to PowerliftingWatch, or anything like that.
  5. Do not position ourselves as a competitor to PowerliftingWatch.
  6. Help them use our data if they ask.

Lifters will use both our site as well as PowerliftingWatch. We want to be on great terms with them, and we don't want to overwhelm them or make them feel like they have to be defensive. Hopefully, both projects will evolve to complement each other.


### How OpenPowerlifting Presents Itself to Lifters

Our role is to highlight and promote lifters' accomplishments. We do this by using our dataset to cast lifters in the most favorable light. Ideally, we want to *surprise* lifters by pointing out to them how much they've improved along some axis, especially when they might not have realized it themselves. Interactions with OpenPowerlifting should be *informative and motivating*.

When promoting lifters, we want to promote *all lifters*, not just elite-level powerlifters. For that reason, although the all-time rankings are important, most of the time we will be speaking in terms of more selective categories:

  1. We want to highlight federation-specific improvements.
  2. We want to highlight lift-specific improvements.
  3. We want to highlight weightclass-specific improvements.
  4. We want to highlight division-specific improvements.
  5. We want to highlight *metadata* improvements. More female lifters? More raw lifters? Growth trends? Etc.
  6. We want to highlight anyone using our data for analytics or statistical analysis.

In summary, because of the breadth of powerlifting, there is always a way to showcase a lifter's small improvements. We want to find clever ways to show people how good they are, to surprise and encourage them. We want to highlight lifters who aren't already well-known within the powerlifting community, so that people know that they are part of a community that cares about them.

As a note, we need to be aware that our own data is incomplete. Therefore we cannot make strong claims about rankings. Instead, we need to use qualifying words, such as "*#7 on the OpenPowerlifting rankings.*" We do not want to implicitly claim that we have all the data already, because although we have a lot of data, there is much that we still have to archive.

Secondarily, our goal is to motivate lifters to respect, recommend, and personally use our website, so that they can check for errors and contribute back to the project. This is done with the following restrictions:

  1. When mentioning our own work, we need to not be pushy: the website should be presented as a good way to see additional information *if they are so interested*.
  2. All of our communication must be done in the community's interest. We should never communicate solely to drive traffic, and we can communicate without attempting to drive traffic at all.
  3. We should only communicate when we actually have something useful to offer.
  4. We should only communicate positively.
  5. We can talk about the project, how it is volunteer-based, and how to help out by checking whether their own data is correct, whether meets are missing, and adding their Instagrams.
  6. *We never mention that there is a Patreon account, and we absolutely never ask anyone to donate!*

The mentality is that we are all part of the powerlifting community, working together, and we want to highlight how we're all improving at all levels of the sport.
