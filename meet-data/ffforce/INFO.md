**For a list of considerations when classifying FFForce competitions**, see the "Special Considerations" section at the end.

Wikipedia: [French article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_fran%C3%A7aise_de_force)

### History

Official sports federations in France are recognized as such by the French Ministry of Sports. They have to meet specific criteria described in this [document](http://www.sports.gouv.fr/IMG/archives/pdf/criteres_de_reconnaissance_HN.pdf). Every year, the Ministry of Sports issues a decree that both renews federations' official status and acknowledges new ones. 
 
Until January 17th, 2015, the official federation for powerlifting in France was the "Fédération française d'haltérophilie, musculation, force athlétique et culturisme" (FFHMFAC). FFHMFAC also served as the official federation for weightlifting, general strength training and bodybuilding.

When [IWF](http://www.iwf.net/) asked from their affiliate feds that they only handle weightlifting, FFHMFAC split; and thus gawas born FFForce, as an independent fed.

### Disciplines

Four powerlifting-specific disciplines are recognized by FFForce:

- Force Athlétique (FA): unequipped powerlifting (as per IPF rules)
- Powerlifting (PL): equipped powerlifting (as per IPF rules)
- Développé Couché (DC): unequipped bench press
- Bench Press (BP): equipped bench press

### Structure

FFForce doesn't organize single, spontaneous meets. Instead, they organize a specific set of competitions, where each competition has a minimal level requirement for athletes.

Levels are based on territorial divisions; by ascending order, those levels are unranked, departmental, regional, interregional, national and international.

FFForce itself only deals with Nationals and international level competitions. It relies on regional chapters ("ligues") to organize events of levels national and below. Interregional competitions sprout from the collaboration of multiple regional chapters.

Unranked athletes can only acquire a rank by participating at a regional or national-level competition. However, it seems a special mention "HM" is written next to the names of athletes who compete unranked.

### Divisions

*The Open division only applies to Nationals*. Other divisions are, per discipline:

#### FA and PL

- "Cadets": ages 15 & 16
- Subjunior: ages 17 & 18
- Juniors: ages 19-23
- Seniors: ages 24-39
- Open: ages 17+ for FA, ages 24+ for PL
- Masters:
  - 1: ages 40-49
  - 2: ages 50-59
  - 3: ages 60-69
  - 4: ages 70+

The Cadet division features special rules:

- on all 3 lifts, a lifter only has 2 attempts instead of 3;
- judges grade a lifter's last attempt on every lift with a mark from 0 to 20 (based on the lifter's technique);
- on every lift L (S, B or D), if a lifter's last successful attempt was done at weight X_l and was graded Y_l, this lifter's recorded best attempt at lift L is: X_l * Y_l/20.

A lifter's total is computed as the sum of their recorded (thus modified) best attempt on every lift.

### Weight classes

Same as IPF.

### Competitions

The list of competitions within FFForce, along with the disciplines they apply to, is noted below. Besides Nationals, every other competition is organized by one or multiple regional chapters.

Competitions are named as they appear on the results page.

Club competitions are irrelevant to OpenPowerlifting, since individual lifts are not recorded; clubs are ranked by the total amount of points they earn. For the sake of completeness, they are still included.

#### Individual

Nationals:

- "France Force Athlétique Open": FA, Open division
- "France Force Athlétique Jeunes": FA, Cadets, Subjunior and Junior divisions
- "France Masters Force Athlétique": FA, Masters divisions
- "France Powerlifting": PL
- "France Bench Press": BP

Other competitions:

- "1er Pas" (or "Premier Pas"): FA, PL, BP, DC
- "Deuxième Pas" (or "2e Pas"): FA, PL
- "Départementaux": FA, PL, BP, DC
- "Régionaux": FA, PL, BP, DC
- "Interrégionaux": FA, PL, BP, DC

#### Team/club

Team competitions:

- "France Villenave": 3 teammates per team, every teammate ("équipier") picks an individual lift and realizes all 3 attempts on the lift.

- "Qualification Jean Villenave": qualifiers for France Villenave.

Club competitions:

- CNAFAPOC: FA & PL
- CNABEDEC: BP & DC

### Special considerations

- Remember: FA is unequipped, PL is equipped, Open division only exists for Nationals.

- Don't bother with special rules for the Cadet division. Keep the best actual attempt on every lift instead of using the modified recorded attempt, and recalculate totals accordingly. However, do not modify places.

- Translations:
  - Bench press: "DC" / "Dec" / "Développé couché" (which serves as the name for both the lift and the discipline even though they're distinct)
  - Deadlift: "SdT" / "S. de T." / "Soulevé de terre"
  - Wilks Coeff: "indice"
  - Wilks Total: "total indice"
  - Bodyweight: "poids de corps"
  - Weight class: "cât. poids" (or "catégorie de poids")
  - Division: "cât. d'age" (abbr. for "catégorie d'âge")
  - First name: "prénom"
  - Last name: "nom"
  - Ranking: "Clas." / "Classt" / "Classement"

- All FFForce competition results are stored as Excel spreadsheets/XLS files.

- Apart from Nationals and "France Villenave", every subsheet records an individual meet (hosted by one or multiple regional chapter(s)).

- *Do not treat lifters with the "HM" label differently*. This label serves purely as a FFForce-specific ranking consideration and is irrelevant to us.

- If you're trying to find it, the discipline (FA/PL or BP/DC) an athlete competed in at a meet is indicated in a row labelled "choix discipline".

- Fields you don't care about:
  - "Licen." / "Licence"
  - "Club"
  - "Lot"
  - "Contrôle anti-dopage" (drug test)
