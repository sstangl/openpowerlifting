2010 Mid-Atlantic Open III

“Hey it’s good to be back home again!”
Although we didn’t play any John Denver classics while we were lifting, it sure was good to be back home and see so many old friends!  With that said, thanks to Doc Junkins and Paul Simmons for making it all happen, and for the generous support of Doc, Paul, Ernie Angell, and Dr. Pat!  God bless you guys!

Despite a nagging shoulder injury, Richard Murphy of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania captured the Champion of Champions award with his 1025 total in the 40-44, 148s.  In addition, Hunter May of Boonsboro, Maryland was the top teenage lifter, Farmville, Virginia’s Jonathan Simmons captured top honors in the juniors, and Hagerstown, Maryland’s Chad Smith was top dog in the submasters division.  The “experienced” group was led by Chaplain Paul Simmons (Best Master Lifter) of Sterling, Virginia, and Ed Lough of Williamsport, Maryland who took home the Best Grandmaster Lifter award.  Congratulations to our Best Lifters and all those that shared the platform; it was a great day! 

Special thanks to our host Dan Stebbing (owner of Anytime Fitness in Hagerstown, Maryland), our flawless platform manager Kevin Prosser, our incredible spotter loaders Ben and Scott Price, and our deadlift jack specialist Paul White for their hard work on the platform; our Head Judge extraordinaire Jerry Osborne and our side judges John Polak (of PolakMade LLC), Paul Simmons, and Doc Junkins; and Maryland’s finest scorekeeper and card shuffler, Lori Michaels.

Most importantly, thanks to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces for defending the freedoms we cherish as Americans and to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!  A Happy Passover to our Jewish brothers and sisters, and Happy Easter to all believers!  

God Bless, Spero

2010 Beau Moore Classic

Praise the Voice of Truth!
Each year, the Beau Moore Classic sets the tone for Florida’s upcoming raw powerlifting season.  And if the energy that was evident throughout the day, coupled with incredible platform performances observed in all three flights, 2010 is going to be an awesome year!  

Bill Beekley’s “Bulldog Powerlifting Team” were joined by Georgia’s Zach Seymour (8-9, 77) to get the lifting underway.  Veteran Bulldog Jessica Lynch (10-11, 88) posted an impressive 245 pound total to capture top honors in Flight A, while Seana Lamba and Kimberly Rosario battled it out in the 66 pound class with Seana winning on bodyweight.  On the men’s side, Zach was flawless on the platform, nailing lifts of 145, 95, and 190 to post the flight’s biggest total at 430 pounds.

Flight B featured three of the nation’s top middleweight lifters in the 165 pound class: Tony Conyers, Eric Talmant, and Brian Schwab.  Guest lifting at the BMC, Tony went 500, 370, 630 on just six attempts, totaling over 9.4 times his bodyweight!  Eric, who directs the Raw Unity Meet, the sport’s premier raw contest, brought the crowd to its feet when he posted the biggest raw deadlift ever at 650 pounds!  And Brian, owner of Orlando Barbell, weighed in at 159 pounds and edged out Eric for Best Lifter honors with his 1425 pound total.  Brian’s wife Trinity and Tampa’s Molly Yerrakadu joined the guys in Flight B, displaying picture perfect form and shattering the record books in their R.A.W. United debuts.  Finally, nineteen year old Nikki Thai, junior Doug Phan, and Masters Champion Rich Cowser showed great poise and strength on the platform, taking their respective age groups.

Tampa’s James Jacobs (40-44, 242) came back from his Raw Unity Meet injury and nailed lifts of 650, 430, and 700 to post the meet’s biggest total at 1780 pounds.  Teenage “phenom” Jordan Wong (18-19, 242) showed great confidence on the platform en route to his 1445 pound total while juniors Derek Fedo (275) and Jeff Barnes (308) lifted exceptionally in their R.A.W. United debuts.  Derek’s 1550 total consisted of a 560 squat, 365 bench, and a 625 deadlift (with a near miss at 640 pounds) while Jeff went 520, 425, and 650 to take the 308s.  And last, but certainly not least, was seeing Beau Moore run through the smoke tunnel, high five all the kids on his way to the platform, and register the biggest raw bench by a master lifter his age at 600 pounds!

Congratulations to all the lifters on their effort and accomplishments, and thanks to everyone for their support of Bill’s team and program at Jackson Springs Recreation Center!  

Thanks to BMC contest director Bill Beekley for hosting the meet; Bill is truly one of the finest human beings in the sport and I am honored to call him my friend!  More thanks to Andrew Yerrakadu, Beau Moore, Tony Conyers, Tom O’Donnell, Bill Beekley, and many others for judging, loading, and spotting; and even more thanks to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces for defending our country and keeping us safe; and the most thanks to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ – the Voice of Truth!

2010 Pull & Praise Deadlift

He Is Risen!
Nineteen lifters joined us at THE GYM to pull (and squat and bench) and praise the resurrected King of Kings!  Nine lifters chose to participate as full power competitors with 2009 Rev. Milton Simmons Memorial Award recipient Kathleen Audet shattering the record books and taking home Best Lifter honors; master lifter Jody Simmons of Orlando, Florida joined Kathleen at the awards ceremony for his 1140 pound Best Lifter total in the 242s.  Additionally, Jody’s son Joseph registered the strongest deadlift in the kid’s (7-U, 8-9) division, Sava Tshontikidis had the top pull in the youth (10-13) division, Brandon Hagerott of Sebastian, Florida (18-19) captured Best Lifter honors in the teenage (14-19) division, and master’s legend Bob Gaynor registered the meet’s strongest deadlift with his 660 pound effort.  Congratulations to all the competitors and Happy Easter to everyone!

Thanks to JD Gaynor, Caryn Tshontikidis, Felicia Vipperman, and Bob Gaynor for officiating; Pete Classon, Blaine Vipperman, and Larry Dromerhauser for loading; Brigid and the folks at Sandpiper Sportswear for the classic “Power in the Blood” shirts, Sir Charles Venturella for the Best Lifter sculptures; and Larry Dromerhauser, Stacie Deutsch, Miles Howell, and Derek Snyder for set up and clean up.

More thanks to America’s finest – our military heroes – for their selfless sacrifice and commitment to our country, and to our resurrected Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for conquering the grave and giving us life eternal!
